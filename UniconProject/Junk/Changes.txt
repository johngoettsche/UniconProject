.$ is not making the assignment

PAbort() = PCancel() and works the same.

PFail() does not compile with the following error:
   icont: cannot resolve reference to file 'filename.u' or 'filename.u1'
	
	also the sample code does not get assign the chars to out.  Is there a problem
	with ? and patterns? needs more investigation.
	
Reminder:
	Unevaluated expressions:  use `n` and not 'n' important to make the distinction.
	it is difficult to make the distinction by looking at the sample code.

add "support image() for the pattern type" to the to do list
